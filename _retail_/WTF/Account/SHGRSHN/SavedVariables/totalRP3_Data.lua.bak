Among the courtesans who tended to their desires, some, by chance, found themselves with child, the unintended consequence of their liaisons.\n\nOne such courtesan, whether by providence or mere happenstance, entertained a man profoundly attuned to the Holy Light. This sacred connection, unbeknownst to her, was passed on to the bastard son she bore in secret. Hidden from the world's prying eyes, this child carried within him the divine spark inherited from his father's communion with the Light.\n\nAs was the custom with the unwanted babes of Goldshire, this child was entrusted to the care of the monks at Northshire Abbey. There, amidst the serene cloisters, he was nurtured and instructed in the humble ways of monastic life. Through arduous physical toil and the tending of vineyards, he learned the virtues of labor and humility. Under the tutelage of the passing paladins of the Alliance, who sought redemption for their sins in Goldshire, he was also schooled in the martial arts.\n\nThe boy grew to appreciate the simple blessings—a garment upon his back, a full belly, and a roof to shield him from the elements. Yet, as the Blackrock Orcs descended upon the vineyards with fire and fury, his fate was irrevocably altered. Conscripted into the service of the Alliance, he was cast onto the perilous chessboard of war, a mere pawn in the grand schemes of conflict. His crown sent him into the fray with scant regard for his life, hardening his heart and extinguishing whatever divine blessing he might have inherited.\n\nNow, a man devoid of rank or noble lineage, bereft of honor and family, he stands at the crossroads of his destiny. With a heart steeled by the hatred for the Horde and its sympathizers, he awaits the decree of fate as he navigates the treacherous currents of Alliance loyalties.\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}\n\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}(An added except simply because I enjoy writing. It is not necessary to read.){/p}\n\n\n{col:ffffff}\"HOLD THE LINE!!\" bellowed the commander, his voice a beacon of authority amidst the chaos, rallying the last remnants of his men to cast aside their instincts to flee for the greater good of the Alliance. \"KEERE! Get to the right side NOW!\" he commanded, directing a lowly footman to fortify the weakened ranks on the right flank. The phalanx had been devastated by the relentless charge of Blackrock worgs, ruthless raiders carving through the battlefield with merciless efficiency.\n\nSHINK! The footman's sword was drawn, though he could only watch in muted horror, his adrenaline stifling the terror as seasoned warriors—hoplites of the phalanx—were cut down, limbs and heads severed by waves of black fur. \"Jon!\" sputtered one of the hoplites, blood gushing from his throat and staining the scorched grass below. \"We can't let them into the abbey!\" The footman raised his shield, standing resolute over the fallen hoplite, determined to defend his comrade with his life.\n\nCLASH! CLANG! The cacophony of war erupted around him, his shield and gladius struggling to fend off the ferocious onslaught of berserker orcs and raiders, the crackle of flames from the burning vineyards adding to the chaos. The footman was no master of combat, but he was accustomed to enduring beatings. His compatriots, honorable men who had grown with him in the Abbey, fell beside him, their bodies consumed by flames or mutilated by the marauding orcs.\n\nThe intensity of the battle consumed the footman, who kept his shield raised, fighting off the Blackrock orcs with unwavering vigilance. His martial skills were no match for the brutes, but his unyielding determination drove him on even in the face of death. \"WE ARE ROUTED! FALL BACK!\" the commander implored, the gravity of the situation evident in his unsteady voice. The footman fell to his knees, bruised and broken, his steel armor and resolute defense sparing him from immediate death, yet he was faltering.\n\n\"Leave me, Jon,\" begged the fallen hoplite, gurgling his last breaths. The footman silently refused, resigning himself to fate, welcoming death like an old friend, standing firm until his body would fail. But then, it all ceased. As suddenly as they had been engulfed, the raiders fell, violently cast away from a sanctified piece of earth beneath the footman, causing the remainder of their forces to retreat. The ground was no longer scorched by flame, and the phalanx stood unscathed, restored.\n\nThe commander approached, confusion etched on his face as he saw his men standing when moments before they had been overrun and dying. All that could be seen was a flash of light, the only event that had heralded this miraculous turn of events. \"It is consecrated...\" the commander murmured, kneeling to inspect the grass. \"The land has been consecrated. The Light blesses our victory!\" The soldiers cheered, thanking the heavens for the divine miracle bestowed upon them, attributing their sudden triumph to a gift from the Light itself.\n\nThe footman remained silent, his gaze locked on the ground beneath him. He was lost in the memory of the one soldier who had perished too soon, the hoplite he had valiantly defended, now lying dead at his feet. His face was carved into an emotionless stone, unmoved by the celebration around him...\n\n\n{img:Interface\\QUESTFRAME\\UI-HorizontalBreak:256:64}",

Though it is presented mostly impartially, most of this, due to the nature of Alexander's past, is not public knowledge. If you don't know what your character would know about Alex, whisper me.)\n\nAlexander Handen is hardly an important figure by any means. The middle child of three, Alexander was little more than an unknown botanist until the Northrend campaign.\n\nLike many children of his generation, Alexander does not remember his true home in Northshire. Not long after his birth, the people of Stormwind began their exodus to Lordaeron, with his family settling in to a camp outside of Southshore. The family returned home when Alexander was a teenager, settling in Goldshire. He never truly felt particularly connected to either place, often shifting between towns across Stormwind, but remained fiercely close with his family.\n\nAlexander's older brother, Jonah, fell at the Wrathgate. Seeking some form of vengeance, Alex enlisted in the Alliance Army. His tour in Northrend was short,  arriving mere weeks before the final attack on Icecrown Citadel, during which he served as a guard at Valgarde Port. Due to his position defending the Alliance's eastern port, Alexander was among the last withdrawn from Northrend. He planned to resign and return home.\n\nHowever, upon his return, he was quickly stationed to Sentinel Hill in Westfall, where he served when the Cataclysm struck. Hearing of the Horde attack on Southshore, Handen once again felt the moral need for vengeance, and decided to remain in the military. Shortly after, however, he was randomly selected to be surveyed for a secretive assignment with SI:7 due to his lack of notable service. The mission was far beyond average intelligence: the Battle of Booty Bay had sent the Bloodsail Buccaneers into disarray, and Handen was to infiltrate a crew, and convince members of the Buccaneers to mutiny, causing further infighting. He was offered a tantalizing reward, in return: if he survived a full year with the Buccaneers, and could report back some form of success, he would be rewarded with his choice of post. Believing the mission was his best way to serve the Alliance, he accepted.\n\nThe year with the Bloodsail was extremely arduous. Constant fighting, constant anxiety, and constant movement. It exhausted Handen completely, but he learned from it. He learned the skills of a pirate- sailing, swordplay, sneaking, and shooting. He had only managed a few small scuffles, but had learned much of the Bloodsail's command structure, and their relations, which he relayed back: after a grueling year at sea, Handen knew his post of choice: The 7th Legion, the Alliance's finest Marines.\n\nLittle did he know, he selected his post right before one of the 7th Legion's worst assignments. When war reached the shores of Pandaria, Alexander Handen found himself as one of many that brought it there. A scout for the 7th Legion, Handen took part in one of the first excursions around the territory that would become Lion's Landing. Much like his time as a pirate, Handen found himself surrounded by constant fighting. When the war ended, Handen breathed a sigh of relief, thinking he could finally put down his blade and return to his garden.\n\nThen the Iron Horde returned. Handen's company was set to be in the first wave of reinforcements for the Alliance Vanguard, until the Dark Portal was destroyed. With priorities shifted, Handen's company was instead deployed to Ashran, where he spent the campaign skirmishing with the Horde, and the Ogres. During these skirmishes, he had been reassigned to a new squad, led by a woman he quickly hit it off with- Elaina Bentham, an unafflicted Gilnean, and a stalwart protector. The two became inseparable outside of missions, and often found their way together in combat- Eliana often charging in to bail Alexander out of a situation. Their relationship quickly became romantic in nature, though the two never seemed to acknowledge it publicly.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, he and Eliana joked about having nothing left to fight, and wondered what would happen to them during peacetime. Alexander considered retiring, but chose against it. Then the Legion invaded, and his sense of vengeance was once again invoked at the death of King Varian. He and Eliana were deployed with Graymane to Stormheim, and defended the Skyfire while the crew fled. Upon returning to Dalaran after the ship was clear, the two took different paths- Alexander being offered a role as an agent of the Uncrowned, and Eliana volunteering to stand with the Valarjar. The pair swore that they'd find each other again at the end of the war. But they wouldn't have to wait that long, both being among their societies' contingents in the Army of Legionfall. They stayed together, like on Draenor, for the rest of the campaign.\n\nWhen the Invasion was finally repelled, and peace returned, the two attempted a return to civilian life, with Alexander buying a home in Lakeshire. Alexander enjoyed returning to his peaceful garden, while Eliana seemed to chafe from the lack of action. Despite the difference, the two greatly appreciated each other's company. But when the Fourth War was declared, both knew their peace would not last. Alexander proposed to Eliana, considering it an extension of their promise to find each other. She declined, telling him to ask again at the end of the war.\n\nUnfortunately, this time, that wait was too long. The two served together in the battle of Stromgarde, in which, during a Horde assault on Alliance fortifications, Eliana was killed. The 7th Legion fought ferociously, but the Alliance was forced on to the backfoot, and forced to retreat. Alexander similarly gave it everything he had, and promptly realized how little he had left to give, after her passing. He received permission to take a long leave of absence following her passing. \n\nDuring his leave, the Fourth War concluded with a ceasefire, and Alexander Handen promptly resigned from the Alliance military. He appreciated the peace, but felt his life had grown...empty. He signed his house over to a single parent who had been widowed during the war, and moved in with his younger sister Selena, and her wife Adeline in Darkshire. He remained with them during the peace, and the journey to the Shadowlands, passing his time growing a small garden and training the new Night Watch.\n\nWhen the expedition to the Dragon Isles began, Alexander hoped for a more peaceful chance to make an impact on the world, and attempted to join the Dragonscale Expedition, who seemingly did not have need of a small-town botanist. Disgruntled, Handen began searching for other outfits travelling to the Isles, which is how he discovered the Vigilants of Proudmoore...",

["TX"] = "Before the Scourge took over the northern lands, Jagen was born to Arlan and Ninian Murtaugh in the city of Stratholme. While his family made a living as small time bakers, his father was a proud soldier of Lordaeron and throughout his childhood, Arlan trained him in the art of war, hoping for the day he makes good to his home by being a strong and loyal soldier. Jagen grew to admire his father's courage, strength and loyalty and took these lessons to heart. Arlan eventually suffered from a permanent injury in the leg that left him\ndisabled during the Second War. A young Jagen at the time took it upon himself to be the man of the house and took responsibility to care for his parents and their business all while he continued his training. He soon after enlisted in the local army once he was old enough to do so, with the blessings of his father and mother. The following years in the army further tempered both his skill and character as a soldier.\n \nDuring the events of the Third War, Jagen took opportunity to serve under young prince Arthas Menethil's army. With the prince having learned of news of an army of undead led by the lich, Kel'thuzad razing and terrorizing various towns, Jagen used his exceptional skills and loyalty as a soldier to help the prince save their homeland.\n\nThat loyalty however was put to the test when his fight against the undead led him back to his hometown of Stratholme which fell victim to the Scourge's machinations. Arthas, believing the only just action was to purge its infected townsfolk, asked his men who had the will to save the land to join him. Jagen despite much confliction in his heart, ultimately believed in the young prince's words and leadership voluntered to stay with the army and do what had to be done.\n\nFate dealt an even crueler hand as he had to face his own parents; his mother Ninian who was turning into a mindless ghoul and his father Arlan who was helpless to do anything. Much hesitation and sorrow griped Jagen's soul that day as he was forced to kill his mother and his own father who may or may not have been infected. His only living family now gone, this act forever changed the soldier as he vowed to prevent further sadness and grief and to save his people no matter the cost.\n\nEventually Arthas's legion led them to the frozen lands of Northrend, where Arthas's chase against the Scourge would end. It was here were he and the rest of his forces met their ultimate fate when the young prince fell into corruption after he wielded the cursed blade, Frostmourne and slaughtered all of his men and raised them as part of the undead army.\n\nJagen now a death knight, obeyed the now corrupt prince Arthas in his every bidding, from destroying the capital of Lordaeron, to massacring the high elves of Quel'Thalas, to felling the magical city of Dalaran. \n\nThe following years after the Third War left the Scourge in a foreboding interim. Jagen resided in the floating necropolis, Acherus alongside his fellow death knights. Despite his master slumbering in the northern wastes, he continued to work for the Scourge, committing various atrocities against the living and further strengthing his dark powers. He soon became a strong member within the dark brotherhood of Acherus and eventually his activities led him to assaulting Light's Hope Chapel years later after the return of the Lich King proclamating a war against all of Azeroth. \n\nHe was granted a second chance, however as he along with the other death knights by a miracle managed to be released from the Lich King's control following the failed assault of the chapel. It was this moment where Jagen faced the ghost of his father who lamented over what his son has become. His mind now free, he fell into a deep despair and remorse for his actions. He knew he was forever damned to be a monster, but in turn vowed to fight for the living and to defend and protect Azeroth by any means necessary.\n\nDuring the events of the war with the Lich King, Jagen rejoined the Alliance and was given opportunity to work alongside a paladin adventurer; named Richter Blanchimont, who while relatively young had experience in championing the Alliance throughout his many adventures. The two formed a rocky but strong partnership as they worked together in the lands of Northrend, fighting against the Scourge and helping countless people, eventually bringing them to Icecrown to join the many heroes and soldiers from both Alliance and Horde in a final battle to fell the Lich King.\n\nEver since then, the duo continued to stay together as best friends and stalwart companions; traveling around the realm adventuring and aiding the people of Azeroth\n",

Cheerful voices and drunken ramblings fell to a cautious whisper as all eyes bent carefully towards the newest patron.\n\nAn Eredar, with skin as red as the blood moon, strode in with his horned head held high. Armor black, bent, and twisted outlined his massive figure; adorned with cruel spikes, decorative bone, and a storied life written in the multitude of dings and dents the plates endured. Strapped to his back was a tainted, crystal Eredar warhammer and demon-forged pike -- still glowing with a rune of empowerment.\n\nThroughout the inn's cozy, firelit communal area, some small amount of individuals began uprooting themselves from their spots. Various expressions of fear, hatred, or some amalgamation of the two were clearly written on some of their faces as they hastily concluded their festivities and departed the establishment's hearth.\n\nAside from the crimson skin and fel-green eyes, his face seemed overwhelmingly similar to that of the, comparatively much more accepted, Draenei. Sideburns spilled down the sides of his head forming into a mustache and beard -- its length falling just short of his plated, powerful chest. \n\nHis face was experienced with the creases of middle age, blemished further by a perpetual expression that would lead someone to believe he has never known happiness. Atop his head sat a protruding, cranial bone structure, with horns jutting from a massive crown. His hair spilled forth from a lazy, functional tie at the back of his head, cascading down to his shoulders in an unkept, scarlet mess.\n\nHe found his way to the bar, leaning atop the counter as his massive, muscular arms, as thick as tree trunks, folded inside themselves. His emerald gaze shifted about the various bottles and kegs situated atop the shelves just behind the barmaid, whom was understandably stunned by the sheer intensity and size of the individual. After the longest moment of her life had passed, he spoke. She jolted in utter shock at his words; dry, heavy, and coarse as blackened stone.\n\n\"I'll take water.\"",

He was strong then, but not strong enough to defeat those who came to destroy the legion, and so he was killed by the blades that swore to vanish the darkness... or so he thought.\n\n     Moments after he became unconsious, bleeding and a breath away from his certain death, he felt something he was all too familiar with, but the other way around. He was being summoned, and was brought to azeroth by a warlock apprentice who was just trying to summon a common lesser demon after he stole his master's book.\n\n    As the apprentice was terrorized as a much powerfull demon apeared before him, he soon noticed that said demon was too wounded to even stay awake, and so Muhann was binded to what he would consider a \"worm\", who didn't even had the strengh to bind an imp.\n\n    Years passed while Muhann was binded, once again doing the will of another, and he was getting fed up with this. As the apprentice evolved his knowledge through the years, so did his powers, but also his hunger for even more power, as naturally happens to most weak willed warlocks. One day he tried to summon an imp mother for his nefarious porpouses, but the demon was way too strong for him, as it did not bent under him, the demon stabbed the aprentice throught his chest, tearing his body soon after.\n\n    After that, Muhann was released from his bind, and was once again free to defend the legion, but the legion was no more. In his abscence, Sargeras was imprisoned and Kil'Jaeden was murdered. The wheight of their presence did not exist anymore, he could feel them, always in the back of his mind, but no more, and so, he was finally trully free.",

But there's one way she never quite matched up to her peers.\n\nAll Illidari hunger. They hunger for demonic power the same way a starving man hungers for food. The least of them lose themselves to this hunger; they devour their enemies and even their peers, who have demonic energies contained within them.\n\nFeladris always struggled to contain that hunger. Even now, as she roams the desolate lands of the Broken Isles, the scent of demonic energies make her mouth water like a ravenous wolf.\n\nHer allies are aware of this weakness and are simultaneously thankful for it and weary of it. They're thankful because she's like a portable garbage disposal, gobbling up their enemies before they can reform in the Twisting Nether. They're weary because something about her seems to suggest that if they look the other way too long, she might turn to her own comrades to satisfy her hunger.\n\nRecently, having risen through the ranks of the Illidari, she has embarked on a series of solo missions on behalf of those who seek the Pillars of Creation. The time is ticking until she makes her first grave mistake. ...{/col}",

Even came under the tutelage of Jaggedfel (player/Bethedis). Borus was taught the basics of honor, discipline and the like but after seeing Jagged betray a man's house by sleeping with his wife and taking bribes, Borus snapped. He said if even the highest honor of Knighthood is so easily tarnished then I won't stand in a kingdom so destined to be corrupted. He left the order and ran into duskwood. There, he met Aelondra, Lunais, Mavellris, Darsha and Amyren and a few others and created the \"Hand of Tyranny.\" A guild that'd house those distraught by the kingdom and give them safe passage to make a new life under his leadership in Duskwood.{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{p:c}{col:ec4906}«·» «·—·» «·»{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{img:Interface\\Credits\\CreditsScreenKeyArt1BC:512:256}\n{h3:c}{col:3F2E27}B{/col}{col:573122}u{/col}{col:70351D}r{/col}{col:893918}n{/col}{col:A13D14}i{/col}{col:BA410F}n{/col}{col:D3450A}g{/col} {col:D3450A}C{/col}{col:BA410F}r{/col}{col:A13D14}u{/col}{col:893918}s{/col}{col:70351D}a{/col}{col:573122}d{/col}{col:3F2E27}e{/col}{/h3}{img:Interface\\Pictures\\9330_gammerita_sepia_256:130:1}{img:Interface\\Pictures\\9330_gammerita_sepia_256:80:1}\n\n{p:c}{col:ec4906}Borus was still leading the Hand, but it was near in shambles when a new order came in. The Court of Shadows, lead by Kitrina Sumners who'd take an odd love/hate relationship to Borus. They both hated each other, yet...never quite hit it off to come close to one another...even if they thought about it. The two guilds clashed over who could really house the fallen in the world's eyes and the CoS won. The Hand fell apart entirely.

He rarely used his birth-right surname and instead earned the moniker \"Dragon's Shadow\" for both his creative combat style , despite being a plated warrior.

These eerie orbs burn with an unearthly intensity, a constant reminder of the demonic energies he has harnessed and the sacrifices he has made.\nIn his middle years, Sultar exudes a sense of seasoned experience and unyielding strength. \n\nHis trimmed white beard frames a face that is both stern and wise, bearing the scars of countless battles fought in the shadows. Each line and mark on his visage tells a story of his tireless quest to protect his people from the darkness that once nearly consumed them.\n\nClad in the traditional garb of a Demon Hunter, Sultar's attire is both practical and symbolic, adorned with mystical runes and tokens of his order. His leather armor, reinforced with dark metal, is designed to provide maximum agility and protection, allowing him to strike with lethal precision and disappear just as swiftly.\n\nSultar's presence is a blend of intimidation and inspiration. To his allies, he is a beacon of hope and resilience, a warrior who has embraced the darkness to fight it from within. To his enemies, he is a relentless predator, a shadow that stalks them even in their nightmares. \n\nWith every swing of his enchanted glaives and every spell of fel magic he casts, Sultar embodies the relentless spirit of the Night Elf Demon Hunters, forever guarding against the demonic threats that endanger their world.\n",

He had a family—a loving mate and two young children—who were the light of his life. His days were spent protecting his homeland from external threats, and his nights were filled with the laughter and warmth of his loved ones.\n\nHowever, this tranquility was shattered when the Burning Legion launched a surprise incursion into their lands. The demonic forces swept through Ashenvale with terrifying speed and brutality. Sultar fought valiantly alongside his kin, but the overwhelming power of the Legion proved too much. In the chaos and destruction, he lost everything—his home was reduced to ashes, and his family was mercilessly slaughtered before his eyes.\n\nGrief-stricken and consumed by a burning desire for vengeance, Sultar wandered the ruined lands, a broken shadow of his former self. It was during this dark period that he encountered Illidan Stormrage. The enigmatic and controversial leader of the Demon Hunters saw potential in Sultar's pain and rage. Illidan offered him a path to harness his anguish and transform it into a weapon against the very demons that had destroyed his life.\n\nDesperate and with nothing left to lose, Sultar accepted Illidan's offer. He underwent the harrowing rituals and training required to become a Demon Hunter, willingly embracing the fel energies that would forever change him. The transformation was excruciating, both physically and mentally, but it also brought him a newfound power and purpose.\n\nWith his blazing fel green eyes symbolizing his unending fury and resolve, Sultar pledged himself to Illidan's cause. He became a relentless hunter of demons, driven by the memory of his lost family and the burning need to prevent others from suffering the same fate. As a Demon Hunter, Sultar found a new family among his brethren and a new home in the relentless battle against the Burning Legion, vowing to eradicate the demonic threat from Azeroth at any cost.",

Despite having a peaceful childhood, she was quickly forced into battle when the savage orcs began using her people for their fel rituals to open the dark portal. Xirid's family was of the lucky few who managed to escape on the Exodar.\n\nXirid lived in the Exodar with her family until the Legion invasion, where she felt called to help defend Azeroth and stand her ground against the threat that had scared the Draenei for so long. It was then she encountered the Lightforged, and in her admiration and dedication to the light, requested to join their ranks by partaking in the ritual. Xirid's faith in the light was strong, and the ritual went smoothly. She fought alongside her new brothers and sisters in arms to drive back the Legion from Azeroth, and defeated Sargeras for good. \n\nShortly after the Legion's defeat, the fourth war between Alliance and Horde broke out, and not so easily forgetting what the orcs had done to her people, Xirid was eager to fight alongside the races of the Alliance for domination of Azeroth. Both of her horns were broken in an incident in battle, and said incident only furthered her hatred towards the orcs.\n\nToday, despite having fought the Legion and in the Fourth War, Captain Fareeya did not think Xirid was ready to enter the Shadowlands and join the fight beyond the veil. So now, Xirid remains in Stormwind, hoping maybe she can feel of use on Azeroth again. \n\n2 YEARS HAVE PASSED\nAfter adventurers returned from the Shadowlands, Xirid took it upon herself to join the Kirin Tor and study alongside their mages. \nXirid is now heavily involved in the Dragon Isles. As a reputable adventurer, she now aids the champions of Azeroth in their endeavors, helping to stop the primalist and Sundered Flame threats. Her feats include aiding in both the defeat of Razageth and Sarkareth, her magic and capabilites being stronger and more polished than ever before. Now, she is attempting to learn both the schools of fire and frost magic, to be more flexible for her allies.\n",

["TX"] = "Backstory:\nForged in War, Refined in Peace\nXaimari was born into the ranks of the Lightforged Draenei, a proud and unyielding warrior of the Army of the Light. For millennia, she served as a Paladin, wielding the Holy Light against the relentless forces of the Burning Legion. Her life was defined by battle, her soul tempered in the fires of endless war. With every victory, she carved another scar upon her heart, a reminder of the comrades lost and the horrors witnessed.\n\nAs a Paladin, Xaimari embodied the virtues of justice and righteousness, her blade a beacon of hope in the darkest of times. But with the final defeat of the Legion, Xaimari found herself at a crossroads. The war that had shaped her very existence was over, and in its place, a profound emptiness settled within her soul. The thrill of battle was gone, replaced by the haunting memories of the countless lives she had taken and the unhealed wounds that festered within her spirit.\n\nJourney to Pandaria: The Vale of Eternal Blossoms\nSeeking solace and a new purpose, Xaimari embarked on a pilgrimage across Azeroth. Her journey led her to the distant land of Pandaria, a place untouched by the horrors of the Legion but scarred by its own ancient evils. There, she discovered the Vale of Eternal Blossoms—a land once radiant with life and beauty, now marred by the destructive forces of the Sha.\n\nAs Xaimari walked through the shattered remains of the Vale, she felt an unexpected kinship with the land. The Vale's struggle to heal from its wounds mirrored her own internal battle. She observed how, despite the devastation, the Vale was slowly mending itself, its sacred mists nurturing new growth from the ashes of the past.\n\nIt was here, in the heart of the Vale, that Xaimari found the first glimmers of hope. The mists that enveloped the land were more than mere vapors—they were a living force, imbued with ancient energies that resonated with the Holy Light she had long wielded. The mists became a symbol of the healing she so desperately sought, a gentle yet powerful force that could soothe the deepest of wounds.\n\nEmbracing the Path of the Mistweaver\nDuring her time in Pandaria, Xaimari encountered the monks of the Mistweaver tradition. Intrigued by their unique blend of physical discipline and spiritual healing, she sought out a master who could teach her their ways. She learned that the mists were not just a natural phenomenon, but a conduit for spiritual energy—a means of channeling both physical and emotional healing.\n\nWith time, Xaimari began to weave the teachings of the Mistweavers with her own deep connection to the Light. She discovered a harmony between the mists and the Holy Light, creating a new form of healing that she called \"Holy Chi.\" Through meditation and practice, she learned to channel this energy into healing mists that could mend wounds, calm minds, and restore the soul.\n\nHer journey was not just about learning a new art; it was about healing herself. Every practice session was a step toward inner peace, a way to reconcile the warrior she had been with the healer she was becoming. The mists became her sanctuary, a place where she could finally lay down the burdens of war and embrace the path of healing and renewal.\n\nA New Role in Azeroth\nWith her newfound mastery, Xaimari returned to her people, but she was no longer the battle-hardened Paladin they once knew. She had become a Mistweaver, a serene and compassionate healer who understood that true strength lay not in the might of her sword, but in the gentle power of the mists. She became a symbol of hope and renewal among the Lightforged, teaching others that the path to victory over darkness was not just through strength of arms, but through compassion, understanding, and the healing power of the Light.\n\nXaimari now walks a new path, one that honors both the warrior she once was and the healer she has become. She continues to visit the Vale of Eternal Blossoms in her meditations, drawing strength from its ongoing healing. The Vale has become a part of her soul, and through her Mistweaving, she spreads its message of resilience and renewal across Azeroth.\n\nHer journey is far from over, but Xaimari no longer fears the future. She knows that, like the Vale, she will continue to heal and grow, finding new ways to bring light and life to a world still recovering from the scars of war. In her hands, the mists are a promise—a promise that no matter how deep the wounds, there is always hope for renewal.\n\n",

Her father was a prominent magister of Silvermoon who would teacher her about magic as she grew up. As Fay reached her teenage years her father started to grow distant from her and her mother. Fay being suspicious of the change in her father would follow him whenever he would sneak away to be alone. She found her father confronted by a powerful demon demanding her and her mother be offered up as sacrifice with the promise of power. Her father refused and the demon struck him down. Fay lashed out at the demon with her magics but was beaten back easily, only being saved by the Silvermoon guards who were called by her mother. The experience left a hatred in her heart for demons, this leading her to follow the ways of darker magics to bind demons to her will so she can then banish them from this world. Once she became well versed in darker magics, she left Silvermoon for the southern parts of the Eastern Kingdoms shortly after the end of the Second War. She's remained in the Elywnn area ever since, using her gifts to serve the Alliance whenever the need arises. ",
