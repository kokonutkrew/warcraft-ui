        WoW UI Designer Release Notes</h2>
    <p>
        <b>These notes refer to wowuides.exe version 1.1.x, the beta release.</b>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This is the WoW UI Designer initially mentioned <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-interface-customization&t=211988&p=1&tmp=1#post211988">
            here</a>. It started off as an idea I had to be able to load in any addon frame
        and edit it like you would a form in Borland C++ Builder (my development environment
        of choice until recently). From that it developed into a full IDE, with the ability
        to edit lua scripts, and xml files in both code and designer views. Hopefully in
        the months ahead, it will develop into the only choice for WoW interface developers
        even if the visual designer is not powerful enough for them.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Native Win32 application developed in C# 2005 requiring .Net v2.0. Compatible with
            Windows XP Home(<i>Untested</i>) and Professional(<i>Tested</i>), Windows 2003 Server
            (<i>Untested</i>), and Windows 2000 Professional (<i>Tested</i>) with the latest
            service packs; </li>
        <li>Multiple docking form interface in the style of Microsoft's development environments,
            provides flexibility for the user and developer; </li>
        <li>Tight integration with <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com">Blizzard's World
            of Warcraft</a> game, providing editors for their open User Interface standard that
            use <a href="http://www.w3c.org">XML</a> and <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua 5.0</a>
            standards; </li>
        <li>Flexible renderer to display any LayoutFrame element defined in an XML file validated
            against Blizzard's UI.XSD schema; </li>
        <li>Embedded ActiproSoftware SyntaxEditor provides syntax highlighting for XML and LUA files, and
            the ability to display calltips in the future; </li>
        <li>Visual designer to create new forms and edit them. Uses skin files to define what
            components can be placed, what properties they have, and how to convert between
            the XML and Windows.Forms; </li>
        <li><b>This release WILL NOT handle your existing UI files within the editor, it can
            only handle files that it itself created. </b></li>
        <li>Lots of other stuff yet to do! </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Installation</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install all latest service packs: <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">Windows
                Update</a>. </li>
            <li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en">
                Windows Installer 3.1</a>, if you don't already have it installed. Unfortunately
                this requires genuine Windows validation, not sure how to get around it. </li>
            <li>Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&DisplayLang=en">
                Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package (x86)</a> </li>
            <li>If you have issues later with the Lua interpretor, install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=262D25E3-F589-4842-8157-034D1E7CF3A3&displaylang=en">
                Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 Redistributable Package</a>, not sure if this
                is required or not. </li>
            <li>Ensure that a copy of World of Warcraft is installed correctly on your system. Use
                regedit.exe to check
                <nobr>
                    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Blizzard Entertainment/World of Warcraft/InstallPath</nobr>
                to see if you have a good install. You can change the path in the wowuides program
                options later, but this reduces the problems. </li>
            <li>Should now be good to go, run the installer <b>WoW UI Designer v1.1.X.msi</b>
                and follow the prompts. </li>
        </ol>
    <h3>
        Notes</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>As of WoW version 1.8.0, the Blizzard XML files no longer conform to their schema
                exactly. In order to load these files correctly, there is an option in the General
                tab of the options dialog to not validate the Blizzard XML files against the schema.
            </li>
            <li>The loading process can take a bit of time, but hopefully you wont have to do it
                as many times as I did when developing it. </li>
            <li>Many addons do not validate against the Blizzard schema, the program does not attempt
                to load these files and will display one error about that file. These can be safely
                ignored unless you want order. You can use <b>Tools | Validate XML</b> to validate
                the current buffer against the schema, if no errors are displayed then it is valid.
                You can then use <b>Tools | Reload Addons</b> to attempt to reload all the addons
                to the file list again. </li>
            <li>The pixel values for location and size are accurate at 1024x768 resolution, but
                are scaled down for lower resolutions by the WoW renderer. </li>
            <li>The image reader looks for .TGA files first, then .BLP files.</li>
            <li>There are 2 skins installed with the designer with overlapping component types.
                The Default skin has fewer properties and should be easier for a beginner to start
                playing with, the Basic skin has most of the properties available exposed and is
                good for users requiring more control. There is no way to convert a component from
                one skin to another without recreating it. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>
        Known Bugs</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Structure view does not work correctly with table element names in the [expr] format
                if expr is not a straight integer. </li>
            <li>Lots of potential exceptions are not correctly trapped, debug output not available
                to users. </li>
            <li>Application uses a s**t load of memory once everything is loaded (~200MB), will
                work to reduce this (but it is beta after all). </li>
            <li>New forms added to a project, but not edited and saved before closing the project
                will load them back as normal xml files. </li>
            <li>Font drawing is a bit off, with characters offset a little high and a bit wider
                than the WoW rendering. </li>
            <li>Find and Replace dialog is not finished. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>
        To Do</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement Undo throughout, you can use CTRL-Z or the context menu on the edit control
                to undo its actions, you cannot Undo what you have done in the visual designer.
            </li>
            <li>Expand the default skin, and provide an interface to add more skins. Document the
                skin file format. Maybe rename to Component Libraries? </li>
            <li>Improve the renderer speed and functionality, so that it more closely represents
                the WoW experience. </li>
            <li>Change the property script editor interface so that it is embedded directly into
                the document view like a normal lua script, thus giving the author access to all
                the resources possible. </li>
            <li>Tighten application security to make the current skin files less dangerous. </li>
            <li>Allow multiple message view windows to be created, each with their own filtering
                states. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>
        Planned</h3>
    <p>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement calltips for LUA and XML code. Use information provided on wowwiki to
                get the current function listing. Eventually provide all the wowwiki information
                to the developer contextually through help windows. </li>
            <li>Improve the editor interface so that all the functionality available in ActiproSoftware.SyntaxEditor
                is exposed to the user, and can be customised fully. </li>
            <li>Develop the UI section of the WoW sandbox, so that most scripts can be run to see
                their effect in the renderer. </li>
            <li>Change the renderer to a DirectX implementation to provide faster drawing speed
                and more effects on texture drawing than the current GDI+ implementation. </li>
        </ul>
