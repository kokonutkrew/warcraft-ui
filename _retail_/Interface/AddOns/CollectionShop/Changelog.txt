- Live checkbox now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.

**2.0**

- Release date: 07/16/2017
- Time since last scan will now show "Live" in green when the Live checkbox is checked instead of showing the last time a GetAll scan was performed.
- Around 20% less auctions are stored for comparison during scanning. They are simply not needed because they are not a Mount, Pet, Toy, or Appearance.
- Around 10% more results will be shown in an Appearance mode Shop. This is due to no longer restricting Sources by type and also the inclusion of hidden Sources that Blizzard deems unobtainable or otherwise chooses to hide.
- Appearances mode no longer immediately starts updating when choosing a mode. A faster modified updating from your collection is performed during Shop once after each GetAll scan or every time you perform a Live scan.
- Added Mounts portrait to Options frame.
- The change mode button (top left on AH tab) is now disabled while scanning to prevent accidental cancellation of a GetAll scan.

- Bug fixed: Sometimes on slow connections, auctions were said to be no longer available when really there was just not enough time given to find the information required. Increased retry attempts to compensate, this should no longer happen.

**1.01**

- Release date: 09/07/2016
- Bug fixed: Occasionally items Already known would be listed as Not Collected due to slow response in retrieving item information. I've increased retry attempts to retrieve item information for filters to avoid inaccurate results. Should an item still fail during filtering a chat message will be shown.
