The copper mines that surrounded the town were both a lifeline and a curse. When she was only eight, a cave-in took her parents, leaving her alone in a world she didn’t understand. With no one to guide her, Telini learned to fend for herself, using her curiosity to explore the town’s nooks and crannies, gathering scraps of gems and metals that sparkled like memories of the past.{/p}\n\n{p:c}As she matured, her impulsive nature led her to craft stunning jewelry pieces, each imbued with fragments of her lost childhood—a way to transform grief into beauty. Yet, her forgetfulness often made her misplace her tools or lose track of time in her workshop, leading to both frustration and laughter from her neighbors, who admired her creativity but found her disorganized and flighty.{/p}\n\n{p:c}Sarcastic as she was it became her shield, a way to deflect the pain of her loss. She danced through life, a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors, yet beneath her playful exterior, the scars of solitude ran deep. In her art, she found purpose, turning sorrow into dazzling jewels that whispered untold stories of love and loss.{/p}\n",

Guarded by her leaves, there were little reason for Velaine to travel outside of the town. She indulged in a life of comfortability. With no worry in her mind. Capable of pursuing her druidic talents, she excelled within restoration. The natural inclination to help, to heal, to fix allowing that uncanny expertise to shine through. Granting her the title of Druid, then a self proclaimed title of Guardian. She were a Guardian after all. For Elune, for the Kaldorei, for Astranaar.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}Till she couldn't be.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}The burning of Teldrassil was an abrasive slash to her reality. Witnessing firsthand the hurt that she'd nursed in others. Now scarring her image. Though bare of any mark, it resided deep within her chest. A constant reminder. Of her spoiled pleasantries that could've been subsided to further protect her home. Could it have gone differently? A plethora of questions playing amongst in her head.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}With no home to return to, Velaine and the other Kaldorei were given refuge within Stormwind. Where she familiarized herself with the chariactures and cultures of the many races that mingled.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}Many travels have accompanied her long years. Proof of that clear upon her face, figure, and heart. Weathered by the realities around her  and yet light gleams within pale blue irises. Despite hardship and struggle, Velaine has found herself to remain an optimistic soul. A caretaker of those less fortunate, in need, and unworthy alike.{/col}\n",

Few minor scars litter about her figure, from a life well traveled. Carrying a well tone to her body that one could easily assume is from tedious care. A firmness within her muscles that somehow accompanied womanly softness.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}Dark raven locks gather against the bottoms of her shoulderblades. Tendrils cascading over her cheeks to frame the strong features of that elf. Little about her could be described as soft. From the sharp line of her jaw, to the high well defined cheekbones, and narrow brows that gave a glare to her softened gaze. Though if anything were to be considered soft? One might look to her eyes. Behind  face value lay a kindness that intertwine with the blue hue. Hiding amongst dark sooty lashes that frame those fox-like eyes.{/col}\n\n{col:a9d7ff}Everything about that dame presented athleticism, femininity, and care.{/col}\n\n\n",

Though like many at the time they eventually leave to join the Scarlet crusade leading theomund down a darker path as once he was old enough to begin training they did not hold back. Compassion was replaced with cold zealotry and any mistake punished harshly for they desired their son to be a soldier without equal within the crusade. While injuried did start to pile upon the young boy eventually he was saved by the Argent dawn during a small skirmish between the two forces. \n\n\n  Within the Argent Dawn Theomund was lucky to be taken in by two father figures one a paladin within the order and continued his training. The other and far more odd one as a orc warrior named Chongork he took Theomund under his wing as a adopted son teaching him matters of honor and conduct though he made sure the boy was not to influenced by orcish customs and culture. Though difficult at first Theomund eventually fully embraced his new life and resented what his birth parents had become.  \n\n  Years passed and Theomund became a proper squire within the ranks of the Dawn and started to show great promise in his combat training and protective instincts the once borderline overzealous and aggressive child has become a stalwart defender of the innocent at least for the time being. It wasnt until the Argent Crusade was formed and the battles of northrend took place that his life took a drastic turn. He lost much in that brutal war including both father figures and reverted to his old ways commiting a sin that to this day he refuses to forgive and he hopes carry to his grave. Once the war was won he in an attempt to make up for his sins commited doubled his effort in defending others even at the cost of ever building scars and injuries often going on his own personal quests to defend villages and areas often overlooked by large orders or simply to difficult to get to by large forces. And to this day he continues walking this path of redemption alone but he always returns when the Crusade has use of him or his aid is required as he will never forget his oaths no matter how injured his body is or weaken his resolve.    \n\n\n\n\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Almost always happy to do walk up rps especially if you require the aid of a paladin \n\n-Welcome to whisper before hand if you have questions or wish to set something up for walk up or preplanned rp.

Though he stands a little over six feet, his form is willowy and not very muscular. He slouches, making him seem shorter than he truly is. He is built for agility and speed rather than strength and power. He strongly resembles his mother, with high cheekbones, green eyes, and orange hair.\n\nThough malnourishment was not kind to him in New Hearthglen, living in Boralus lately has built him up slightly.\n\nAlways covered head to toe to cover a medley of scars.\n\n{link*https://imgur.com/a/3X1nHF9*Art!}\n{/col}{/p}\n\n\n{h3:c}- - - {col:E6BF83}H I S T O R Y{/col} - - -{/h3}\n{p:c}{col:ffffff}\n\nLeoric grew up in the frigid wastes of Dragonblight, tucked away from the rest of Azeroth in an environment of hatred and fear. Beneath the sunny mask, there is something unsettling in the boy's eyes.\n\nNowadays, he is trying to carve a path of his own and live a simpler life. He is doing a spectacular job of failing that goal.\n\n{/col}{/p}",

Anyone familiar with Death magic could detect hints of it on him, but nothing outrageous. Traces of the Light linger with him.\n\nAnything listed below is fair game for pre-established relationships or walk up material.

Subsequently, she was raised by her older sister Nayimah.\n\nIn her adolesence, Korkali developed a deep aptitude for magic, fel magic in particular. So gifted was she, the various factions within the Wastewanders began manipulating her for their own ends. They fought over her while Nayimah tried her best to keep her safe.\n\nFollowing the death of Caliph Scorpidsting after the Cataclysm, the infighting between the Wastewanders reached a peak. Korkali and Nayimah threw their lot in with Shan the Seer, a remarkably accurate fortune teller and former advisor to Scorpidsting. Over the years, Shan began to make moves for her band of Wastewanders to join the Alliance, sending Nayimah, for her diplomatic skills, and Korkali, to keep her out of trouble, as envoy to Stormwind.\n\nSince leaving the faction conflict in Tanaris, Korkali has sworn off fel magic, refusing to use it in any instance. She now studies the other schools of magic, taking a particular interest in frost magic.\n\nIf you find Korkali out \"in the wild\", she's likely studying magic, reading or glowering at people who bother her.",
