<H2>WoW UI Designer Tutorial</H2></P>
<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3></P>
<P>
This is a quick start tutorial for WoW UI Designer v1.1.x (just called <I>wowuides</I> from now on).  It contains 
steps on how to get started using the program to create a UI for your addon.</P>
<P>
<H3>Installation</H3></P>
<P>
Refer to <A href="../release.html">Release Notes</A> for information on installing the application.</P>
<P>
<H3>Setup (Optional)</H3></P>
<P>
Once you have installed the application, you can <B>optionally</B> set it up to not work directly within your
WoW game directory.  This can be advantageous if you feel that loading from the files takes longer than loading
from the mpq files.</P>
<P>
Say that you installed <I>wowuides</I> into the <B>c:\wowuides</B> directory and just want to work within that,
and that WoW is installed in <B>c:\games\WoW</B>.  I will provide steps using Command Prompt commands, but you can
use Windows Explorer or any other method you like:</P>
<P>
<OL>
	<LI>Move the interface directory:<BR>
	<PRE><B>echo -- Do a full copy of the interface folder
md c:\wowuides\interface
xcopy c:\games\wow\interface\*.* c:\wowuides\interface /e
echo -- Now delete the contents of the folder (don't worry, you have a full backup if the previous step succeeded)
rd /s /q c:\games\wow\interface
echo -- You still need your addons, so copy them back, recreate the directories first
md c:\games\wow\interface
md c:\games\wow\interface\addons
echo -- Copy the addons back to the WoW directory
xcopy c:\wowuides\interface\addons\*.* c:\games\wow\interface\addons /e /i</B></PRE>
	Those are the precise steps, if there is an error, then do not continue.  If you are a more advanced user, then
	there are safer steps to achieve this if you wish.
	<LI>Now start the <I>wowuides</I> program, it will not initialise correctly, but OK the error and go to the
	<B>Tools</B> menu and select <B>Options...</B>.  In the first general page, there is a <B>
        Work Directory</B> option, 
	in that text box type <B>c:\wowuides</B> and press OK.
	<LI>Close down the <I>wowuides</I> application and restart, it should now be using 
        the new copy of the WoW interface files.
</OL>When you are ready to test an addon in WoW, you can use the <B>Project | Copy 
Files to Install Directory...</B> command to copy the files into the install 
directory to be loaded by WoW on start up.<P>
<H3>Getting Started</H3></P>
<P>
Lets get started by creating a new project and setting up a basic frame.</P>
<P>
<TABLE>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">1. Create a new project: Go to <B>File | New Project...</B> menu item, or press CTRL-SHIFT-N key combination.</TD>
		<TD></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">2. A text input form is now displayed, enter the name of our new project called <B>Tutorial Project</B> 
		and	press OK.</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\newproject.jpg"><IMG src="pics\newproject.jpg" alt="New Project Dialog" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">3. Now the Project properties page is displayed, enter some information so that you, 
		and your addon users know what the addon is about.  Some basic sample information is shown below, you can 
		use your own name ofcourse~</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\projinfo1.jpg"><IMG src="pics\projinfo1.jpg" alt="Project Properties Form" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">4. Now save the project, go to the <B>File | Save</B> menu item, or press CTRL-S key 
		combination.  You should find yourself in the interface directory, select the <B>Addons</B> directory and 
		create a new folder by pressing the third button from the left shown here, name this folder <B>TutProj</B>.  
		Now go into the folder you just created and type <B>tutproj</B> for the file name and press save.</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<IMG src="pics\newfolder.jpg" alt="Create New Folder">
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">5. We are now ready to start adding files to the project.  Go to the <B>Project | Add 
		New Script File</B> menu item, you should now see a new file TutorialProject.lua in the Project Explorer.  
		Now go to the <B>Project | Add New Form</B> menu item and you will see a TutorialProjectForm.xml file added 
		to the list.</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\projexp1.jpg"><IMG src="pics\projexp1.jpg" alt="Project Explorer" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">6. Save the project again (CTRL-S).</TD>
		<TD></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">7. Double click on TutorialProjectForm.xml.  This will open a dialog asking what skin to
		create the form from, select <B>Default</B> and continue.  Now the UI designer will display.</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\uides1.jpg"><IMG src="pics\uides1.jpg" alt="UI Designer" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">8. Now to set up the form, select the <B>Text</B> property from the list to the right 
		(near the top), enter something like <B>Wowuides Tutorial</B>, leave the rest alone and go down to the 
		script property <B>OnEvent</B>, for this enter <B>TutFormEvent();</B> exactly, finally go down to the 
		<B>OnLoad</B> script property and enter <B>this:RegisterEvent("VARIABLES_LOADED");</B> exactly.</TD>
		<TD></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">9. Now for some visuals, within the toolbox usually located at the bottom right of the 
		screen there is an item called <B>Label</B>, select this and move the cursor over the form.  The cursor 
		should be a cross shape, move it to the top left of the form and click the left mouse button once.  Something 
		like below should be displayed, if you moved the mouse while the button was down, then your label is likely 
		to be smaller, but it will still be there and selected.</TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\uides2.jpg"><IMG src="pics\uides2.jpg" alt="UI Designer with Label" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">10. Now set up the properties for the label to:<BR>
		<B>Location</B> = <B>32, 64</B><BR>
		<B>Size</B> = <B>336, 16</B><BR>
		<B>(Name)</B> = <B>$parentCountLabel</B><BR>
		<B>Horizontal Alignment</B> = <B>LEFT</B><BR>
		It should look something like -></TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\uides3.jpg"><IMG src="pics\uides3.jpg" alt="UI Designer with Label setup" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">11. Now go back to the toolbox and place a Button component with the following 
		properties:<BR>
		<B>(Name)</B> = <B>$parentDoneButton</B><BR>
		<B>Text</B> = <B>Done</B><BR>
		<B>Location</B> = <B>160, 350</B><BR>
		<B>Size</B> = <B>100, 22</B><BR>
		<B>OnClick</B> = <B>TutorialProjectForm:Hide();</B><BR>
		It should look something like this -></TD>
		<TD align="centre">
			<A href="pics\uides4.jpg"><IMG src="pics\uides4.jpg" alt="UI Designer with Label and Button" width=300></A>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">12. Now save everything, go to <B>File | Save All</B> menu item, or press CTRL-SHIFT-S 
		key combination.</TD>
		<TD></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">13. Our form is done for now, so double click on TutorialProject.lua in the Project 
		Explorer to bring up the text editor window for scripting.</TD>
		<TD></TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">14. Because we called a function <B>TutFormEvent()</B> on the OnEvent event of our 
		form, we need to define it.  This tutorial does not go into lua scripting, so the contents are in the 
		picture across, save this.
		<TD align="centre">

		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">15. In the function created above, we referenced a variable called TutSavedVar, we 
		want this variable to be saved across uses of the addon, so we need to set it into the saved variables.  
		Go to the menu item <B>Project | Properties</B>, this will redisplay a form we have seen earlier.  Now 
		press the <B>Add...</B> button located to the right of the Saved Variable text, for the Variable Name 
		enter <B>TutSavedVar</B> and press OK. Save the project and the project properties should look like -></TD>

		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD valign="top">16. Now all that is left is to start WoW and see if it worked!</TD>
